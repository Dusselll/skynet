      <h2>Industry data</h2>

      <!-- make into infographic -->
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tom:</strong> Game Developer - Senior Software Developer, External Productions </li>
        <li><strong>Elliott:</strong> Game Developer - Senior Software Developer, External Productions </li>
        <li><strong>Oliver:</strong> Entrepreneur/Own Boss/ Free - Lancer</li>
        <li><strong>Mitch:</strong> IT support Technician  </li>
        <li><strong>Eric:</strong> Financial Planner </li>
        <li><strong>Lloyd:</strong> DevOp Engineer  </li>
      </ul>

      <p>In “Group Name” we had a variety of ideal jobs from our team members. We’ve decided to group the ideal jobs into exclusively IT related careers and into careers that use IT. We’ve grouped Game Developers, IT Support Technician and DevOp Engineer into IT exclusive career paths and Entrepreneur and Financial Planner in careers that use IT.  </p>

      <p>Looking at the career skills that are in greatest demand provided by the Burning Glass Technologies, we can see that a lot of the skills that are in demand for BGTOCC Family: Information Technology have a lot of common elements that you’d expect across almost all careers not just IT related careers so would be applicable to our members who haven’t chosen IT related careers. </p>

      <p>These common skills that would be just as applicable for a Game Developer, an Entrepreneur, an IT Support Technician or a Financial Planner, the skill in most in demand by being required by 36.3% of all posting in the Burning Glass Technologies study is Communication Skills. Good Communication Skills is required in all careers whether that be because you’re working in a team, customer facing or business facing, as long as you’re interacting with anyone being able to effectively communicate ideas and understand other people’s ideas is key to success. We also see that a lot of the other skills can be grouped under Communication Skills which further highlights how important being an effective communicator is. For example, having skills in Writing (12.8%), having Presentation Skills(3%), being Articulate(1.8%) and having good English skills (2.1%) all come under the umbrella of Communication Skills.</p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>The second highest in demand is Problem Solving which 13.4% of posting required, this is another skill that would be required across all careers whether than be a Financial Planner or DevOp Engineer. In life whether that be professional or otherwise, not everything goes your way and being able to work through any potential issues that come up and deal with the unexpected without having to be babysat is key to all careers. Again, highlighting how important Problem Solving is in careers is that a few of the other required skills can be grouped with it such as, Troubleshooting (9.4%) which by definition means solving problems and Creativity (6.1%) which is used to solve problems in perhaps new and effective ways.</p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>Moving over the IT specific skills while not all the skills will directly transfer from the IT related skills, there are still skills that are required that would be useful. Skills such as Microsoft Windows which is required by 9.8% of listing, would be useful in using a microsoft computer in being an Entrepreneur and IT Support Technician as of March 2019 over 800 million devices use Windows 10 alone (https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-says-windows-10-is-now-on-more-than-800-million-devices/). Having a good understanding of Microsoft Windows would also include having good skills in Microsoft Office which another 4.8% of postings wanted. </p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>As a team we believe that all the general skills listed on the Burning Glass Technologies study are required on some level or another. However, a few of the skills that may be required less than others could be Researching as if you do come into any troubles you might have to research a solution but our ideal roles you would like to think once we reach them we would have a clear understanding on what we need to do, Researching is in demand on 5.9%  the postings. Another less used skill could be Leadership as all our ideal jobs aren’t roles that are in charge of large teams, leadership is required in 4.2% of posting. Continuing with that the groups ideal jobs aren’t being in charge of large groups another less used skill could be Mentoring which is required in 3.7% of postings. This being said all these less used skills we believe would still be useful to have and understand to be an effective professional. </p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>Another skill that is applicable to both IT careers and IT related careers is having good knowledge of Project Management which is required by 8.2% of posting. Every endeavor you get into whether that be as a hobby or professionally can be broken down into being a project. Employers clearly in the IT industry see Project management as an essential skill, when using Project Management skills in a professional environment another skill that is looked for is understanding the Business Process which is required by 3.8% of posting.  </p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>For more IT related skills that would be applicable to the IT related careers, having and understanding in C# and Git are skills that are required for our ideal jobs related to IT. However these are skills that aren’t highly ranked on the Burning Glass study with C# only required by 6% of posting and Git only needed by 4.5% of postings. The most required skills are SQL, JavaScript and JAVA which are required by 13%, 10.7% and 10.4% respectively, these are all skills and programming languages that members of “group name” should learn to a comparable level as they are required by more than a third of the IT industries jobs. </p>
      <!-- make into infographic ^^ -->

      <p>As we can see there are a lot of skills that carry over from the IT related careers to careers that are not exclusively IT related whether that be generic skills or even IT skills. The skills you need in a professional environment carry over to all careers. </p>

        <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>

          <h4>What does it do? </h4>

          <p>An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that is able to navigate and deliver a payload, Whether that be people or cargo, without the need for a human to interact with the controls. It is able to scan and detect its surroundings and react without driver intervention. With a truly autonomous vehicle, a human is not needed to perform any driving function or decision making. the first official autonomous vehicle was developed in 1977 by the Tsukaba mechanical engineering laboratory. Which used an old analogue computer, that used 2 cameras to pick up special lane markings to facilitate autonomous driving. The first autonomous road trip was in 1995 by CMU'S navlab 5, driving across America, from Pittsburgh to San Diego. Driving autonomously for all but 50 of the 2850 miles. </p>
          <p>There are multiple levels of automation when it comes to vehicles. These range from level 0 with no automation, to level 5 with full automation, in which even a steering wheel is optional. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Level 0 means there is no automation or driver assistance. All control of the vehicle is up to the driver.</li>
              <li>Level 1 is driver assistance, where only a single automation system is present, such as cruise control.</li>
              <li>Level 2 is partial automation, where the vehicle has limited control over acceleration and steering. A human driver is still required to monitor the situation and can intervene at any time.  </li>
              <li>Level 3 automation is what we have included is some high end vehicles today, such as a tesla. This is where automation can control the vehicle under the right circumstances, such as on a highway. The vehicle is able to monitor its surroundings and can avoid obstacles and collisions with other non automated vehicles and obstructions.  </li>
              <li>Level 4 is where the vehicle is able to run autonomously in most situations, And is aware of its surroundings and can react to most situations. However a human driver is still required to monitor the situation.  </li>
              <li>Level 5 is complete automation. This is where the vehicle can run autonomously in all situations. A driver is not required, and a steering when can even be excluded. </li>
            </ul>
          <p>These days driverless cars are undergoing rapid change and development. Currently autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors to detect road markings and objects. Radar is used to detect nearby vehicles and other moving objects. allowing for the vehicle to detect if an object is moving toward or away from it. It is used mainly for collision avoidance and other features such as adaptive cruise control and blind spot detection. Lidar uses a laser to scan its surrounding and create a 3d view of the area around the vehicle. Its high accuracy and small processing requirement made it great for quickly determining immediate surroundings. The vehicle uses multiple cameras to view its surrounding and detect vehicle, people, animals and any obstruction that may enter the road way. Its also used for object recognition. such as traffic lights, emergency vehicles, construction hazards etc. GPS is used to give the car its global position and a map of its surroundings to facilitate autonomous driving. Right now the main technological innovation is image and data processing. The onboard cameras are able to gather most of the data used for driving under normal conditions. however the main drawback is the amount of raw data that needs to be processed and interpreted by the computer. This is slow and right now it is not ideal for situation that require immediate action. Machine learning and neural network will most likely be the technology that moves this forward and allow reliable cheap autonomous vehicles. The other innovation we will see is seamless communication between vehicles. Having the ability to have a direct data link to all vehicles mean that the vehicle will not have to guess what every other vehicle is doing. Saving valuable processing power. </p>

          <h4>What is the likely impact? </h4>

          <p>Autonomous vehicles are likely to be a world changing invention. just like electricity or the internet before it. It is set to be one of the biggest game changer in vehicle history. The ramification will be felt in just about every industry. </p>
          <p>Just as the introduction of autopilot in aviation has made air travel the safest way to travel, The impact from global adoption of level 5 autonomous vehicles can not be understated. To be able to hop into a autonomous vehicle and have the confidence that it will be able to react to any situation and keep you safe in your travels will forever change how we use vehicles. In the private sector, it will make tasks like food delivery or package delivery much more reliable and efficient. Ride sharing services will benefit hugely from the adoption of autonomous vehicles. A customer will be able to open an app and be able to request a ride. Then to be able to step into a autonomous vehicle and be able to be delivered anywhere without having a driver will be monumental to the industry. Speaking of industry. Having automated trucking and freight delivery will facilitate a major boom in the freight industry. However all this novation and automation comes at a cost. It will put millions of people out of a job and will kill the trucking and taxi industry as we know it. The ramification of this will be immense. With millions of people now looking for jobs , unemployment will skyrocket and there will be a backlash towards autonomous vehicles. Some experts say that this will increase the divide between the rich and the poor. With wealthy people being able to enjoy the luxury of autonomous vehicles, while the poor that have been kick out of their jobs and will most likely no be able to afford the autonomous vehicles that took their jobs in the first place. </p>
          <h4>What is the likely impact? </h4>
          <p>I think this will affect me in many ways. To be able to jump into a car and get some work or study done would be great, or to catch up on some much needed sleep. To catch a automated bus to a train station and arrive precisely on time will greatly increase my usage of the public transport system. I have insomnia and do not drive when i have been unable to sleep. With autonomous vehicles i will be able to travel allot more. If we had level 5 autonomous vehicles, i would feel a lot safer knowing that most people will be using autonomous vehicles, and that the likelihood of getting into an accident will be drastic lowered. With increased safety and reduced death toll attributed to motor vehicles, car insurance will become a lot more affordable. Currently if i am waiting on a delivery i am given a time frame of when the parcel will be dropped off at my door. With autonomous vehicles that time frame will be a lot more accurate. And i will be able to work around that time a lot better. I worry about my family driving. My mum drives almost an hour to and from work everyday, which worries me as she can come home rather tired. But with level 5 autonomous vehicles i will not have to worry about that any more. My sister works with race horses and has to both schedule deliveries and get some herself. With autonomous vehicles her workload will be significantly reduced. My grandparents live almost 2 hours away in Snowtown. They come down to Adelaide weekly and i worry about them driving so far in their old age. But with autonomous vehicle they will be able to come down a lot more often. I believe with the adoption of autonomous vehicles will come the rise in online purchases. My cousin works in a car dealership. I think the amount of people that will buy a car from a dealership will decrease, and i think this would make his job a lot more difficult.  </p>

      <div class="robots">

        <h3>Robots</h3>

        <h4>What does it do?  </h4>

        <p>Robots help aid humanity in various ways. From simple things around the house, to aiding in major productions at factories. They help with minor but important areas of farmwork to assist in areas of medicine and healthcare. Around the house, we can see robots in the toys that kids play with and with small vacuum robots. Within farming, robots have been developed to detect when a fruit is ripe and harvest them. Robots are also capable of detecting the location of weeds and removing them. And if you want to look closer to something more familiar, then look towards the robotic tractors that can be hooked up to the same machinery as a regular tractor. Robots also help in the production of products as they have become a major part in factories. Robots are often used in the production line to help with mass produced products as machines do not get bored much like a human would. They can be used to do a task that would be simple but a high amount would be necessary. In cases where a human touch is needed, robots can aid the human in the workload to make it easier for them. Though the production of food and physical goods is not the only way that they help in the improvement of human lifes. Robots can also be used in the medical industry. An exoskeleton can be used to help someone who has lost the ability to control their body as much as they would normally. The development of prosthetics has allowed some people to regain a limb, some being controllable with the mind. We also see robots being aids in surgery. We also see robots deployed into areas that are normally too dangerous for humans to enter. A good example of this would be the robots often used in space and sent to planets to help further aid in research. Another example would be the robots used for military purposes. When used by the military, it can be used to scout potentially dangerous areas to assess for enemies or other dangers. It can also be used to scout areas in disaster response to help save time with sending humans on the ground. In the future we will likely see further improvements in the areas above. Another would be robots in factories would be able to produce parts for their own bodys. Then with other robots, both detect where robots are damaged and repair the broken parts, in theory, allowing them to run autonomously without human intervention. What has allowed the advancement of robotics to make this possible would be the further development in artificial intelligence which gives the robots their “minds” to move on their own. Another advancement that has aided in the development in robotics is the advancement in autonomous vehicles as some robots use a similar technology as the autonomous vehicles. The development of robotics has allowed for several advantages for humanity. With the further increase in population, the need for more products both food and non food has been met with the increase productivity. Though a disadvantage of this is the loss of human jobs, forcing people if they want to keep a job, to change to what their profession is. Another limitation is that at the current moment, robots can only do what they have been programmed to do. This does mean more complex jobs require humans. Through the advancement of machine learning and greater artificial intelligence. </p>

        <h4>What is the likely impact?  </h4>

        <p>With the use of robots increasing in our daily life, the amount of products available to the increasing population can be met. Because robots can do one or a few tasks forever given they do not break down or run out of material to work with, this has allowed for greater efficiency. Because of this, robots are being used in areas and tasks that would have been mainly taken by humans. Because of this, the worry of human jobs being taken over by these robots. Though this does not mean that the amount of jobs for humans has been reduced. It just means a change of where humans are required. Robots are not at the point that they can work by themselves. Human supervision is needed as a checking to detect if there is a fault in production. Also because robots will eventually need repair, the increase in maintenance jobs has increased along with jobs to create new and better robots. Also there are still jobs that require a human touch and some people prefer products that are hand made even if the cost is more. Another change in workplaces is that medical facilities will have an increase in preference in hiring doctors and nurses that would be more familiar with the medical robotics if the facility used them. It would also see an increase in people capable of being skilled in the operation and repair the robots made for medical purposes. There would also be an increase in people working in areas other than production as their jobs would have been taken away by the robots and do not have the necessary skills or experience to shift jobs in the same field. </p>

        <h4>How will this affect you?  </h4>

        <p>With the further improvement of robotics in the medical industry, the overall health of the human population will improve. With the improvement of robotics in surgery, the likelihood of complications will decrease. With the improvement of robotics in prosthetics, it will allow for humans who have lost limbs to walk again or grab objects with their mechanical hands. With robots being used in farming, it can help improve the overall production of food without the need to hire as many people as producing the same amount without the usage of robots. The improvement with robots in production will likely improve what products are available to people while also decreasing the price of the products. For people that are still in school, robots taking over jobs will not affect them in a major way as they would be able to work with the improvement in robotics. As for the people who work in production, they could lose their jobs as the higher ups decide to replace the humans with robots and they do not have any other skills that the company would want to keep. So overall, the younger generation will likely to improve with the introduction of robotics as their jobs will likely work with it. As for the parents of those younger generations, it depends on what jobs they have and their education. For people with a good education it is not likely to affect the work security in a major way. As for the population as a whole, the improvement of life will likely improve for most members of society that the robots will reach. As for the people in rural areas, robots and the improvement will likely have little effect. </p>
